main.py

	— In this file we are we are installing all the required packages through subprocess library.
	— Also we are executing 4 dataset files, one after another

chestxrays.py
	
	— Dataset Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tolgadincer/labeled-chest-xray-images
	—  Initially we are downloading dataset from the drive link and saving it local stroage -  https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1TvNW_EAKekz9UAUkT9MT_Z6kFMVrb9-H&export=download
	— Creating Working directory to save output - outputs/chestxraysDataset /
	— Executing different various optimizers over different architectures.


flowers.py

	— Dataset Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition
	— Initially we are downloading the dataset from drive link and saving it locally - https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Gb-_LbLxBJyrblL5wDE1k_HTX5Y6ubTw
	— creating working directory to save outputs - outputs/floweDataset/
	—  Executing different various optimizers over different architectures.

waterBotteles.py

	— Dataset Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/water-bottle-dataset
	— Initially we are downloading the dataset from drive link and saving it locally - https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_xadMaT0gBeDpJwvIDnXNkxRA1-8Mx6P
	— creating working directory to save outputs - outputs/waterDataset/

MNIST - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer

For this dataset we are having 3 files
	“mnist_vgg16_resnet50.py”
	“mnist_inceptionresnetv2.py”
	“mnist_xception.py”

We are downloading data-set only in the first file from drive link - https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1Y2dYLTfyQn5ua0TUmpLkmhSr-6V6y7BT&export=download


“mnistManual.py”

	— Initially we collected 56 hand-written images of different resolutions and from different devices.
	— Loaded the saved model of all the architetcures
	— Using those model to predict the digits.
